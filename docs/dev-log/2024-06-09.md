## 2024-06-09: Testing Customized Go Program for API Fetching

Today, we conducted extensive testing on our customized Go program designed to fetch data from Alpaca's API. Our objective was to compare its performance against our previously implemented Python async method under similar conditions.

### Test Setup and Findings:
- **Connection Method:** Due to an IP ban presumably from excessive testing, we utilized a VPN, which slightly reduced our connection speed.
- **Pool Size Variance:** We experimented with different pool sizes in the Go program:
  - Size = 1: 396 calls/min
  - Size = 2: 359 calls/min
  - Size = 3: 402 calls/min
  - Size = 4: 272 calls/min
  - Size = 5: 402 calls/min (with errors indicating "retries exceeded")

### Observations:
- The Go program's performance was not linear with the pool size, which suggests that there might be optimal concurrency levels for API calling that do not simply scale with the number of workers.
- Despite the reduced network performance due to the VPN, the Go program significantly outperformed the Python async script, making around 400 calls per minute compared to Python's 145 calls per minute.

### Conclusions:
Although the customized Go program demonstrates superior performance, indicating a substantial advantage in using Go for API fetching tasks, we have decided to use this knowledge as a proof of concept rather than immediately implementing these customizations. For now, our focus will shift towards building a more comprehensive and general system. The insights gained will guide future optimizations but are not a priority in the current phase of development.
