## 2024-12-19: Data Transfer Performance Benchmarking

### Overview
Today we developed and implemented a comprehensive benchmark suite to compare different data transfer methods:
- REST API (using FastAPI)
- gRPC
- Arrow Flight (local)
- Arrow Flight (containerized)

The goal was to evaluate the performance characteristics of each method when transferring large datasets between services.

The script can be found [here.](../../code/STB_storage_manager_py/tests/benchmarks/test_arrow_flight_vs_grpc_vs_rest/test_arrow_flight_vs_grpc_vs_rest.py)

### Implementation Details
1. Created a benchmark script that tests all four methods using the same dataset
2. Used DuckDB to generate and store test data
3. Implemented proper error handling and logging
4. Added Docker containerization for Arrow Flight to simulate network transport
5. Measured three key metrics:
   - Prepare time: Time taken to prepare data for transfer
   - Transfer time: Time taken to transfer data between services
   - Parquet write time: Time taken to write received data to Parquet format



### Benchmark Results

#### Test Conditions
- Random 64-bit integer data
- Three different dataset sizes: 1M, 5M, and 10M rows
- Tests run on local machine with containerized service for network simulation

### Key Findings
1. Arrow Flight consistently outperforms both REST API and gRPC by significant margins
2. Performance differences become more pronounced with larger datasets:
   - At 10M rows, Arrow Flight is ~91x faster than REST and ~19x faster than gRPC in transfer time
   - Even with network simulation (Docker), Arrow Flight maintains superior performance
3. REST API performance degrades most rapidly with increased data size
4. gRPC maintains reasonable performance but still significantly slower than Arrow Flight
5. Arrow Flight's performance scales almost linearly with data size

### Conclusions
1. Arrow Flight is the clear winner for large-scale data transfer scenarios
2. The performance gap between Arrow Flight and traditional methods (REST/gRPC) widens with larger datasets
3. Even when network transport is required (Docker case), Arrow Flight maintains excellent performance
4. The overhead of JSON serialization in REST API becomes a significant bottleneck at scale

### Next Steps
1. Implement Arrow Flight as the primary data transfer mechanism
2. Consider additional benchmarks with:
   - Different data types beyond integers
   - Network latency simulation
   - Concurrent client requests
   - Memory usage monitoring
