# 2024-09-27: Development of Custom DuckDB Manager for Stock Data Storage

## Objective
To develop a custom DuckDB-based storage system tailored for efficient stock data management. This system is designed to provide a lightweight, high-performance alternative to distributed solutions like Apache Iceberg with PySpark, while simplifying the process of storing, querying, and managing stock data in a single-node environment.

## Files and Components

### 1. `duckdb_manager.py`
This file serves as the core of the custom DuckDB manager, responsible for handling interactions with the DuckDB database. Key functionalities include:
- **SQL Query Execution**: Provides methods for executing optimized SQL queries specifically for stock data storage and retrieval.
- **Snapshot Management**: Handles the management of stock data snapshots, including saving, updating, and cleaning up outdated snapshots.
- **Error Handling**: The SQL queries were refined to ensure smooth operation, addressing edge cases such as mismatched data types and query format errors.
- **Refactoring**: Several improvements were made to the structure and functionality of the code, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### 2. `db_utils.py`
This utility module provides helper functions to streamline database operations. Key utilities include:
- **Cleanup Snapshots**: The `cleanup_snapshots` function has been refined to make use of the `db_directory` parameter, ensuring snapshots are cleaned up efficiently without redundant operations.
- **Database Directory Management**: Additional utility functions ensure that the DuckDB database directory is managed effectively, making it easier to maintain and organize stock data files.

### 3. `__init__.py`
This file serves to initialize the DuckDB storage package, ensuring that the `DuckDBManager` and other components are properly imported and set up for usage in the larger stock trading bot system.

## Key Achievements
- **Efficiency**: DuckDB was chosen for its ability to handle complex queries on a single node without the overhead of distributed systems like Spark. This approach reduces complexity and improves the performance of stock data operations.
- **Error-Free SQL Handling**: Significant effort went into refining the SQL queries to ensure error-free interactions with DuckDB, particularly when dealing with time-series data and large stock datasets.
- **Modular Design**: The DuckDB manager was refactored to be more modular, allowing for easier future expansions and optimizations without affecting the current functionalities.

## Lessons Learned
- **Simplification over Complexity**: Moving away from distributed storage solutions like Spark to a lightweight DuckDB setup has drastically simplified our architecture, making it easier to maintain and reducing unnecessary overhead for smaller datasets.
- **Scalability**: While this solution is efficient for the current data volume, future considerations may require additional optimizations or transitions to a more scalable solution if the data grows significantly.

## Next Steps
- **Enhance Data Query Functions**: Add more advanced stock data query capabilities to support backtesting and real-time trading operations.
- **Integrate with Trading Logic**: Ensure seamless integration between the DuckDB manager and the trading algorithms, allowing for smooth data retrieval during live trading scenarios.
- **Data Storage Optimization**: Investigate compression techniques and further optimizations in data storage, including indexing strategies, to improve query performance.

## Conclusion
The development of this DuckDB manager marks a key milestone in simplifying our data storage approach for the stock trading bot. The new system offers a highly efficient and modular storage solution, allowing us to focus more on improving the bot's overall functionality while maintaining easy data management.
