## 2024-12-28: Apache Arrow Flight Performance Benchmarks

### Test Overview
We developed a benchmark script to compare two different Apache Arrow Flight server implementations:
1. Simple Flight Server - loads entire table into memory
2. Stream Flight Server - processes data in batches

The test used three different dataset sizes, each with 1,000 columns containing random float values.

### Analysis
1. Performance Scaling:
   - Simple Flight: Shows near-linear scaling with data size
   - Stream Flight: Upload time scales poorly, while download time remains relatively stable
   
2. Relative Performance:
   - At 10K rows: Stream is ~47x slower
   - At 100K rows: Stream is ~15x slower
   - At 200K rows: Stream is ~14x slower

3. File Size Impact:
   - Despite significant increases in row count, the Parquet file size remains nearly constant
   - This suggests excellent compression for our numerical data

### Conclusions
1. For our stock data use case, where:
   - Each file contains data for one stock/timeframe combination
   - Row counts typically range from 1K to 200K
   - Column count is fixed and manageable
   
   The Simple Flight Server is clearly the better choice.

2. The Stream Flight Server's performance characteristics make it unsuitable for our needs:
   - Excessive upload times
   - No significant benefits for our data volumes
   - Additional complexity without compensating advantages

### Decision
We will proceed with the Simple Flight Server implementation for our stock data storage system, as it provides:
- Better performance across our expected data sizes
- Simpler implementation
- More predictable scaling characteristics
