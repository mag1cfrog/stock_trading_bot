## 2024-06-07: Asynchronous API Call Performance Testing and Future Planning

### Objective
To evaluate the performance of asynchronous API calls using a custom Python implementation and compare it with the performance of Alpaca's official SDK under the same conditions.

### Methodology
Implemented an asynchronous method in Python to make continuous API calls to Alpaca's data endpoint for a specified large time range. This test was conducted to measure the number of API calls that could be successfully made within one minute.

### Results
- **Asynchronous Python Implementation**: Managed to achieve approximately **160 API calls** per minute.
- **Alpaca Official SDK**: Reached around **130 API calls** per minute using the same parameters and conditions.

### Conclusion
The custom asynchronous Python approach demonstrated a higher throughput in terms of API calls per minute compared to the official SDK. This improvement underscores the potential benefits of using native Python asynchronous capabilities to enhance API interaction efficiency, particularly for I/O-bound tasks.

### Next Steps
- **Planning and Implementing Data Storage**: The next phase will focus on developing an efficient structure for initial data storage. Despite the custom implementation's higher performance, we will utilize Alpaca's official SDK for data extraction due to its ease of use. This decision allows us to focus more on building and optimizing the overall system architecture.
- **System Architecture Development**: Prioritize the design and implementation of the system's big picture, ensuring that data handling and storage are optimized for scalability and performance.
