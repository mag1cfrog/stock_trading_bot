## 2024-06-06: Performance Testing of Alpaca Official GO SDK

### Objective
Evaluate and compare the performance of Alpaca's official GO SDK against the previously tested Python SDK using similar parameters.

### Methodology
Performed API call tests using the official GO SDK for Alpaca. Two distinct parameter sets were used to measure the performance under different data request sizes:

1. **Small Time Range Test** — This test aimed to maximize the number of API calls within a minute, simulating a high-frequency data fetching scenario.
2. **Large Time Range Test** — This test involved fetching a larger span of data per call, expected to assess the SDK's handling of more substantial data loads.

### Results
- **Small Time Range Test**: Achieved **397 API calls** within one minute.
- **Large Time Range Test**: Achieved **133 API calls** within one minute.

### Comparison with Python SDK
The performance difference between the GO SDK and the Python SDK is relatively minimal. Both SDKs showed similar capabilities in handling high-frequency and high-volume data requests, though there was a slight edge with the GO SDK in the high-frequency scenario.

### Conclusion
The Alpaca GO SDK demonstrates robust performance, slightly outperforming the Python SDK in scenarios demanding higher API call frequencies. Both SDKs are adequately equipped to handle substantial data volumes, indicating efficient handling of larger data ranges without significant performance degradation.

### Next Steps
- Explore optimization opportunities in the usage of both SDKs to further enhance performance.
- Consider detailed profiling to identify any underlying bottlenecks or inefficiencies in data handling.
